SmartDeviceLink Android Proxy

We're still working on creating documentation for each of these individual repositories, but in the meantime, you can find more information about SmartDeviceLink [here](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_core/blob/master/README.md) and [here](http://projects.genivi.org/smartdevicelink/about).

You can also find some branches that have yet to be merged into this GitHub project on the GENIVI page [here](http://git.projects.genivi.org/?p=smartdevicelink_android.git;a=summary).
